# Activity Plan for Week 1

## What you have to do all weeks

We expect you to work for 13 hours every week on this module, as follows:

 * 2 hours attending in person lectures **5-7pm on Mondays** in [Sport and Exercise Sciences LT2 (Y14)](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/contact/directions/index.aspx), except in the last week of term, which is in Computer Science UG04.

 * 2 hours in the Lab UG4 (Computer Science building) **4-6pm on Tuesdays.**

 * In some weeks, however, there will be an assessed test in the Lab UG04. Check [Canvas](https://canvas.bham.ac.uk/courses/65779/assignments).

 * 9 hours studying handouts, possibly also watching recorded lectures about them, doing unassessed but mandatory exercises, and recording your performance on Canvas.

## What you have to do this week

### Check that you have the prerequisites to attend this module

This module *requires* either

 1. Functional Programming in Haskell,
 2. Data Structures and Algorithms,
 3. Theories of computation, and
 4. Mathematical and logical foundations of computer science

or being a Math/CS undergrad student at the University of Birmingham and having 1-3 above.

If you are an *Advanced MSc* student and don't have *all* of the above four prerequisites, you can only take this module with special dispensation from the Program Director.

If you have any doubts, please check with your lecturer either after the lecture or during the lab.

### Check the GitLab repository

 * [GitLab](/README.md)

### Attend the Monday 5-7pm lecture

No previous preparation needed.

### Attend the UG04 Lab in Computer Science at 12-2pm

We assume that you have attended the Monday lecture. If you haven't, please catch up by reading the handouts for this week.

 * There will be a lecture.
 * You will also get exercises to do during the lab.

We've also recorded a [more structured version](https://canvas.bham.ac.uk/courses/56295/external_tools/12214) of what we taught in the lab, which an additional feature that shows the emacs keystrokes in a side panel.

### Important

 * The first lab is particularly crucial. Make sure you don't miss it. In general you should not miss any lab, as it includes taught material delivered by the lecturers.

 * [Lab1 information and tasks](/files/LectureNotes/files/lab1.lagda.md)

### Complete the lab exercises by the end of this week

 * And report your performance on Cavas.

 * We will provide solutions in a file, some of them explained in videos.

### Read handouts for this week

 * [Introduction](/files/LectureNotes/files/introduction.lagda.md)
 * [Resources](/files/LectureNotes/files/resources.md)

### Watch videos for this week (optional)

The videos are not mandatory if you can manage to understand the handouts.
The lectures will repeat what is in the videos, but not everything. This is because we will both explain and discuss the material of the handouts, and sometimes do things that are not in the handouts or the videos.
