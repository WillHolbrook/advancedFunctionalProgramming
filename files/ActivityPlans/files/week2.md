# Activity Plan for Week 2

### Get ready

Make sure you studied the handouts for Week 1, including the things that were not discussed during the lecture, before you attend this week's lecture.

### Attend the lecture on Monday 5-7pm

It would be beneficial to watch the pre-recorded lectures, if possible, before the lecture. They are 1hr 30min in total.

### Attend the lab on Tuesday 4-6pm

 * [Lab 2 sheet](/files/LectureNotes/files/exercises/lab2.lagda.md)

### Watch videos for this week

This time watching the pre-recorded lectures is mandatory, because they introduce the same material as the in-person lecture from a different perspective. If you couldn't watch them before the lecture, please watch them before the lab if possible, and you must watch them before the end of the week, in any case.

 * [Propositions as types and proofs as programs](https://bham.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Sessions/List.aspx?folderID=8f365e4d-c15a-46b7-985b-af9e010659f4)

   These are blackboard lectures that explain the ideas informally, but still precisely. In the in-person lectures we do the same, but in Agda instead, and also adding some important missing things, discussed at the end of the pre-recorded lectures.
