# Activity Plan for Week 2

This time attending the pre-recorded lectures is mandatory. This is because during the in-person lecture we will do practical Agda coding live, with the pre-recorded lectures as a pre-requisite.

### Attend the UG04 Lab in Computer Science at 12-2pm

No previous preparation needed other than to complete the study and practice of the material of Week 1.

 * There will be a short lecture at the beginning.
 * You will also get exercises to do during the lab.
 * You will get explainations and sample solutions during the lab.

### Watch videos for this week - mandatory this week

Deadline *Thursday noon*.

 * [Propositions as types and proofs as programs](https://canvas.bham.ac.uk/courses/56295/external_tools/12214)

   These are blackboard lectures which explain the ideas informally, but still precisely. In the in-person lectures, we are going to do this again but in Agda, and also adding some important missing things, discussed at the end of the pre-recorded lectures.

### Read handouts for this week

Deadline *Thursday noon*.

 1. Propositions as types and basic Martin-L√∂f type theory
    1. [Basic Martin-L√∂f Type Theory](/files/LectureNotes/files/curry-howard.lagda.md)
    1. [Empty type](/files/LectureNotes/files/empty-type.lagda.md) `ùüò`
    1. [Unit type](/files/LectureNotes/files/unit-type.lagda.md) `ùüô`
    1. [Binary type](/files/LectureNotes/files/binary-type.lagda.md) `ùüö`
    1. [Product types](/files/LectureNotes/files/products.lagda.md) `Œ†`
    1. [Sum types](/files/LectureNotes/files/sums.lagda.md) `Œ£`
    1. [Binary products](/files/LectureNotes/files/binary-products.lagda.md) `_√ó_`
    1. [Binary sums](/files/LectureNotes/files/binary-sums.lagda.md) `_‚àî_`
    1. [Identity types](/files/LectureNotes/files/identity-type.lagda.md) `_‚â°_`
    1. [Natural numbers](/files/LectureNotes/files/natural-numbers-type.lagda.md) `‚Ñï`
    1. [Negation](/files/LectureNotes/files/negation.lagda.md) `¬¨`
    1. [Function extensionality](/files/LectureNotes/files/function-extensionality.lagda.md)

This one can be read after the lectures:

 2. [Propositions as types versus propositions as booleans](/files/LectureNotes/files/decidability.lagda.md)


### Attend the Thursday 4-6pm lecture at Old Gym LG12

 * You **must** watch the pre-recorded video lectures before the in-person lectures as the latter will cover the same material from a different perspective, with live Agda coding.

 * You **must** read the handouts carefully enough before the lecture to be able to fully participate in the discussions.

### Complete the lab exercises by the end of this week

 * They are unassessed.

 * But you must report your performance on Cavas.

 * We will provide solutions in a file, some of them explained in videos.

 * [Lab exercises](/files/LectureNotes/files/exercises/lab2.lagda.md)

 * [Homework](/files/LectureNotes/files/exercises/homework2.lagda.md)
