# Activity Plan for Week 5

This week we will look at the material of Week 4 more closely, and get started with the new material distributed below, for which we will also need Week 6 to complete.

### Attend the UG04 Lab in Computer Science at 12-2pm

No previous preparation needed other than to complete the study and practice of the material of Week 4.

 * There will be a short lecture at the beginning.
 * You will also get exercises to do during the lab.
 * You will get explainations and sample solutions during the lab.

### Complete the lab and homework exercises by the end of this week

 * They are unassessed.

 * But you must report your performance on Cavas.

 * We will provide solutions in a file, some of them explained in videos.

 * [Lab exercises](/files/LectureNotes/files/exercises/lab5.lagda.md)

 * [Homework](/files/LectureNotes/files/exercises/homework5.lagda.md)

### Watch prerecorded lectures for this week before the Thursday lecture

We will continue working on the material of the following videos for Week 4:

 * [Proofs by induction](https://bham.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Sessions/List.aspx#folderID=%2225dc5630-a271-480b-b27b-ae4300a3e31d%22)
 * [Isomorphisms](https://bham.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Sessions/List.aspx#folderID=%2253fc20d9-89fe-49dd-be96-ae42014d2431%22)

We will also start working on the material of the following videos:

 * [More types and isomorphisms](https://canvas.bham.ac.uk/courses/56295/external_tools/12214)

### Study the following handouts before the Thursday lecture

We will continue looking at the material of the following handouts:

 1. [Propositions as types versus propositions as booleans](/files/LectureNotes/files/decidability.lagda.md)
 1. Isomorphisms `â‰…`
    1. [Definition and basic examples](/files/LectureNotes/files/isomorphisms.lagda.md)
    1. [Binary sums as a special case of sums](/files/LectureNotes/files/binary-sums-as-sums.lagda.md)
    1. [Binary products as a special case of products](/files/LectureNotes/files/binary-products-as-products.lagda.md)
    1. [List and vector isomorphisms](/files/LectureNotes/files/vector-and-list-isomorphisms.lagda.md)
 1. More types, their elimination principles, and their isomorphism with Basic MLTT types
    1. [Booleans](/files/LectureNotes/files/Bool.lagda.md)
    1. [Maybe type](/files/LectureNotes/files/Maybe.lagda.md)
    1. [Finite types](/files/LectureNotes/files/Fin.lagda.md)
    1. [Lists](/files/LectureNotes/files/List.lagda.md)
    1. [Vectors](/files/LectureNotes/files/Vector.lagda.md)

We will additionally start working with the following handouts:

 1. [Natural number functions](/files/LectureNotes/files/natural-numbers-functions.lagda.md)
 1. [Boolean functions](/files/LectureNotes/files/Bool-functions.lagda.md)
 1. [Finite types functions](/files/LectureNotes/files/Fin-functions.lagda.md)
 1. [Lists functions](/files/LectureNotes/files/List-functions.lagda.md)
 1. [Vector functions](/files/LectureNotes/files/Vector-functions.lagda.md)


### Attend the Thursday 4-6pm lecture at Old Gym LG12

 * You **must** watch the pre-recorded video lectures before the in-person lecture as the latter will cover the same material from a different perspective, with live Agda coding.

 * You **must** read the handouts carefully enough before the lecture to be able to fully participate in the discussions.

### Exercise solutions for previous weeks

 * Are available [here](/files/LectureNotes/files/exercises).
