# Activity Plan for Week 6

There is no new material this week. We will continue with the material distributed in Week 5.

### Get ready

Make sure you studied the handouts for Weeks 1-5, including the things that were not discussed during the lecture, before you attend this week's lecture.

### Please fill the module questionnaire

Your feedback is important to us and we take it into account:

 * [module questionnaire](https://forms.office.com/e/kQrnVAxzRq)

For the question about the "Canvas page", please consider GitLab as part of that, as we put our material on GitLab rather than Canvas.

### Attend the lecture on Monday 5-7pm

### Attend the practice test on Tuesday 4:00-5:50pm

 * If RAP with 25% extra time, please arrive to start the test at 3:30pm. We agreed with the Quantum Computing module lead that you will be allowed to leave early from the exercise class if you are attenting this module. We ask you not to leave the test venue before 4pm.

### Complete the homework exercises by the end of this week

 * [Homework 6](/files/LectureNotes/files/homework6.lagda.md)

### This week we will have the Practice Test

The practice test is in Week 6 in the UG04 lab on Tuesday 4:00-5:50pm.

  1. We will use real Test 1 that the students took last year.
  1. There are 5 questions of increasing difficulty.
  1. We will run it in strict exam conditions.
     1. Mobile phones should be put on silent mode and away from your desk after you enter the attendance code.
     1. You must bring your university ID card.
     1. You will sign an in-person attendance list, in addition to entering the given code in the university app.
     1. Like in exams, people are not allowed to leave in the last 10 minutes of the test to avoid disruption.
  1. You must use a lab machine (unless given permission by Welfare to use your own machine if you have a RAP).
  1. If you are entitled to have extra time, please get it touch with both Martin Escardo and Eric Finster by email so that we can discuss the arrangements with you.
  1. The test is open book. You may use:
     1. Your files stored in a lab machine and your own notes on paper.
     1. Canvas and the GitLab repository.
     1. The [Agda documentation](https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
     1. The [emacs reference card](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/refcards/pdf/refcard.pdf), [manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/index.html) and [guided tour](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/tour/index.html).
     1. No other web page.
     1. No social media.
  1. You may import any handout or solution given in our teaching material (even the ones that are available and we haven't taught yet). You may also copy-and-paste and modify any existing code in the GitLab repository if you find this useful.
  1. You may write helper functions and definitions if you wish.
  1. You **must not** modify the type of any question.
  1. The test will be marked manually jointly by the lecturers and TA's, and we will award marks for partial correctness. The questions are based on your lab exercises and homework. The marks don't contribute to your module grade, as this is only a practice test, and are produced only for the sake of giving you feedback.
  1. We aim to return the marks within 1 week.
  1. Test 1 will be in Week 8 (see [module calendar](files/Resources/calendar.md)).
  1. It will cover the material of Weeks 1-5.
