# Activity Plan for Week 7

This is revision week. No new handouts are given, but we are giving you exercises for revision.

### Get ready

Make sure you studied the handouts for Weeks 1-5, including the things that were not discussed during the lecture, before you attend this week's lecture.

### Attend the lecture on Monday 5-7pm

We will discuss the solutions of the practice test, focusing on areas that the students found challenging, as well as provide new examples of problems which apply the techniques we have developed so far.

### Attend the lab on Tuesday 4:00-5:50pm

### Complete the lab exercises by the end of this week

### Next week we will have Test 1

Test 1 is in Week 8 in the UG04 lab on Tuesday 4:00-5:50pm.

  1. There are 5 questions of increasing difficulty, similar to the practice test.
  1. We will run it in strict exam conditions.
     1. Mobile phones should be put on silent mode and away from your desk after you enter the attendance code.
     1. You must bring your university ID card.
     1. You will sign an in-person attendance list, in addition to entering the given code in the university app.
     1. Like in exams, people are not allowed to leave in the last 10 minutes of the test to avoid disruption.
  1. You must use a lab machine (unless given permission by Welfare to use your own machine if you have a RAP).
  1. The test is open book. You may use:
     1. Your files stored in a lab machine and your own notes on paper.
     1. Canvas and the GitLab repository.
     1. The [Agda documentation](https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
     1. The [emacs reference card](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/refcards/pdf/refcard.pdf), [manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/index.html) and [guided tour](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/tour/index.html).
     1. No other web page.
     1. No social media.
  1. You may import any handout or solution given in our teaching material (even the ones that are available and we haven't taught yet). You may also copy-and-paste and modify any existing code in the GitLab repository if you find this useful.
  1. You may write helper functions and definitions if you wish.
  1. You **must not** modify the type of any question.
  1. The test will be marked manually jointly by the lecturers and TA's, and we will award marks for partial correctness. The questions are based on your lab exercises and homework. The marks don't contribute to your module grade, as this is only a practice test, and are produced only for the sake of giving you feedback.
  1. Test 1 will cover the material of Weeks 1-5.
