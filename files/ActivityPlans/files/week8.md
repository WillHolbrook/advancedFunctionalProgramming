# Activity Plan for Week 8

In Week 8, after the test on Monday, we are going to start working on
an application of the material we have been learning in the first half
of the course.  We are going to look at a real-world example of
specifying some program behavior and proving that an implementation is
correct with respect to that behavior.

In particular, we will look at the problem of specifying and implementing
sorting algorithms.

### Attend Test 1 in UG04 Lab in Computer Science at 12-2pm

Good luck!

### Watch prerecorded lectures for this week before the Thursday lecture

* [Strict Total Orders](https://bham.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=3c1b14f4-a37a-4a9a-a485-ae5e0164233b)
* [Sorted Lists](https://bham.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=844742a2-1597-4b17-8cc0-ae5e016422d4)
* [Specifying Sorting](https://bham.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=2a835747-0070-49b7-92e0-ae5e01642318)

The videos for this week will be posted soon.

### Study the following handouts before the Thursday lecture

We will start our investigation of sorting algorithms with the following material:

1. [Strict Total Orders](/files/LectureNotes/files/strict-total-order.lagda.md)
1. [A Specification of Sorting](/files/LectureNotes/files/sorting.lagda.md)
1. [Insertion Sort](/files/LectureNotes/files/insertion-sort.lagda.md)

### Attend the Thursday 4-6pm lecture at Old Gym LG12

 * You **must** watch the pre-recorded video lectures before the in-person lecture as the latter will cover the same material from a different perspective, with live Agda coding.

 * You **must** read the handouts carefully enough before the lecture to be able to fully participate in the discussions.
